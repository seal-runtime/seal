# time.init

`local time = require("@std/time")`

A time library with `time.wait` and functions for creating `Duration` objects.

---

### time.wait

<h4>

```luau
function time.wait(seconds: number) -> true,
```

</h4>

 Blocks the current VM for approximately `seconds`, accurate to millisecond-ish precision.
 Implemented with Rust's `thread::sleep`.

---

### time.datetime

<h4>

```luau
datetime: typeof(require("@self/datetime")),
```

</h4>

 `DateTime` and `TimeSpan` libraries.

---

### time.years

<h4>

```luau
function time.years(y: number) -> Duration,
```

</h4>

 Constructs a `Duration` representing `y` years. This assumes years are `365` days long.

---

### time.months

<h4>

```luau
function time.months(months: number) -> Duration,
```

</h4>

 Constructs a `Duration` representing `months` months. This assumes months are 365 / 12 days long.
 <br> For accurate months, use `TimeSpan`s instead.

---

### time.days

<h4>

```luau
function time.days(d: number) -> Duration,
```

</h4>

 Constructs a `Duration` representing `d` days.

---

### time.hours

<h4>

```luau
function time.hours(h: number) -> Duration,
```

</h4>

 Constructs a `Duration` representing `h` hours.

---

### time.minutes

<h4>

```luau
function time.minutes(m: number) -> Duration,
```

</h4>

 Constructs a `Duration` representing `m` minutes.

---

### time.seconds

<h4>

```luau
function time.seconds(s: number) -> Duration,
```

</h4>

 Constructs a `Duration` representing `s` seconds.

---

### time.milliseconds

<h4>

```luau
function time.milliseconds(ms: number) -> Duration,
```

</h4>

 Constructs a `Duration` representing `ms` milliseconds.

---

### time.microseconds

<h4>

```luau
function time.microseconds(us: number) -> Duration,
```

</h4>

 Constructs a `Duration` representing `us` microseconds.

---

### time.nanoseconds

<h4>

```luau
function time.nanoseconds(n: number) -> Duration,
```

</h4>

 Constructs a `Duration` representing `n` nanoseconds. This is accurate only up to ~285 years (expressed in nanoseconds).
