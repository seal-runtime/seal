# serde.base85

`local base85 = require("@std/serde/base85")`

good for serving binary stuff in a digestable form for serving things on the internet
almost exactly the same as `base64`, with a slightly smaller footprint in the form
of a ~25% expected binary size increase when encoded vs. a ~33% increase from base64
